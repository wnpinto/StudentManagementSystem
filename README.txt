********Student Money Management**************


*Project Description*
This new system will keep track of all students� 
spending patterns or habits. The system will also 
keep track of all purchases made by the student. 
To keep track of the system, a �wallet� based 
approach will be used. The wallet will keep track 
of budget limit, amount of money spent and amount 
of money left. The wallet will also keep a �receipts� 
section, which displays all the purchases made by 
the student. Based on the receipts, the budget plan, 
and the amount of money left and being spent, 
the system will display a report of spending habits 
in a form of a graph with descriptions. 
This new system should be able to give the student 
the information they need and to manage their 
spending accordingly.

This is a project that is designed to help me, as I've noticed over the years that I spend too much money without realizing my budget.
So, this app will be to help me visualize my spending habits, therefore saving alot of money.
